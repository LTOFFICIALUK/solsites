 can you stop fucking talking about it and just completely fix the problem by rebuilding everything that needs rebuilding, without changing the ui of the editor, thats my only request. everything needs to be fixed, i dont care how much it fucks up as long as you fix it, but please keep the ui of the editor the same. 

you're a professional developer with a masters degree at coding, prove it. 

this should be rebuilt and restructured so that the editor uses the exact same processes for saving each project, template or component and isnt using different processes for anything, everything should run through the same pipeline, i dont know the name, youre the professional, but do it like a slug
